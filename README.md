# my_doodle_classifier

Classify hand drawn objects in canvas using convolution neural networks

## Getting Started

I have used doodle dataset; opensourced by google, you can get it from [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/quickdraw_dataset/full/numpy_bitmap)


* To train the model, I used google colab; code -> [train.pynb](../blob/master/train.pynb)

* To run the project 

    ```python
    python server.py
    ```

* then go to `127.0.0.1` a.k.k as [HOME](https://i.imgur.com/G2yvPTl.png)
